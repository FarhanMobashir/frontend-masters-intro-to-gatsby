Now that our site is built, we're ready to share it with the world!

Make sure all your changes are committed, then push them to your GitHub repo.

```bash
# make sure all the files are tracked
git add -A

# commit the files
git commit -m 'site ready to deploy'

# push the files to GitHub
git push origin main
```
